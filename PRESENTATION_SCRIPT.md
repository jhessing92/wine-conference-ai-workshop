## SLIDE 1: Title (30 seconds)

**[Show title slide with ShooflyAI logo]**

> "Good morning everyone. I'm Steve from ShooflyAI. Before we start - pull out your phones. This isn't a lecture where I talk at you for 45 minutes. You're going to be doing things."

**[Pause for phones]**

> "No tech skills required. If you can send a text message, you can do everything we're about to do."

---

## SLIDE 2: What We're Doing Today (1 minute)

**[Advance to expectations slide]**

> "Here's what the next half hour looks like:
>
> First - hands-on exercises. You'll generate real outputs on your phone that you can actually use.
>
> Second - everything is winery-specific. Tasting notes, marketing, owner decisions. No generic business stuff.
>
> Third - you'll walk out with a toolkit. Everything you create today saves to your phone."

**[Point to "The Rule" box]**

> "One rule for today: AI drafts, you decide. Everything the AI generates is a starting point. You always have the final say. Don't like something? Change it. That's the whole point."

---

## SLIDE 3: Get Started - QR Code (2 minutes)

**[Advance to QR code slide]**

> "Alright, let's get you set up. Point your phone camera at this QR code."

**[Wait 30 seconds]**

> "You should see a page that says 'AI Can Do That' at the top with the Shoofly logo. Raise your hand if you're having trouble."

**[Walk around, help anyone stuck]**

> "If your phone won't scan, pair up with your neighbor. Sharing screens is totally fine."

**[Wait until ~90% have it open]**

> "Great. You're looking at the workshop hub. This is home base. All the exercises are listed here. Keep this page open - we'll come back to it."

---

## SLIDE 4: Today's Exercises (30 seconds)

**[Advance to exercise overview]**

> "Quick overview of what we're covering:
>
> 1. Tasting Notes - generate three versions from one wine
> 2. Role Track - pick owner, vineyard, or tasting room and get role-specific tools
> 3. Event Marketing - full marketing kit in 60 seconds
> 4. Numbers to Decisions - paste any numbers, get one clear action
> 5. Lightning Lab - grab bag of quick tools
>
> Plus everything saves to your Toolkit at the bottom."

> "Don't worry about keeping up. If you fall behind, you can always catch up later. Everything saves automatically."

---

## SLIDE 5: Exercise 1 - Tasting Notes (5 minutes)

**[Advance to Tasting Notes slide]**

> "Let's start with something every winery needs: tasting notes."

**[Point to QR code]**

> "Scan this code, or tap Exercise 1 on your hub page."

**[Wait for everyone to get there]**

> "Here's what's going to happen. You're going to:
>
> 1. Pick a tone - Classic, Modern, Warm, or Elevated
> 2. Hit Generate
> 3. Get three versions: website copy, menu description, and staff talking points"

> "Use the sample wine data for now. If you have your own wine info, you can paste that instead."

**[Walk through the flow on your phone]**

> "Select your tone... hit Generate with Vineyard AI..."

**[Wait 15-20 seconds for generation]**

> "And there you go. Three versions, same wine.
>
> Look at the differences. The website copy is detailed and polished. The menu version is tight - fits on a small card. The staff talking points are conversational."

**[Give them 2 minutes to explore]**

> "When you're done, you'll see a popup asking what you want to do. Save it to your toolkit, copy it, or skip to move on. Pick one and it'll take you to the next exercise."

**[Wait for most people to finish]**

> "Show of hands - who got output they could actually use? Maybe with a few tweaks?"

**[Acknowledge hands]**

> "That's the point. First draft in 10 seconds. Your editing time is what matters."

---

## SLIDE 6 & 7: Exercise 2 - Role Track (8 minutes)

**[Advance to Role Track intro slide]**

> "Now we're going to split up - but everyone does this at the same time."

> "Scan the code or tap Exercise 2. You'll see three options."

**[Advance to Three Paths slide]**

> "Pick the role that fits what you do day-to-day:
>
> **Owner** - If you're looking at numbers, making decisions about inventory, pricing, strategy. You'll get a sales analysis with top/bottom performers and three specific actions for this week.
>
> **Vineyard** - If you're in the field. You'll get a 7-day checklist, a decision tree for weather conditions, and questions to ask your viticulture expert.
>
> **Tasting Room** - If you're customer-facing. Scripts for welcoming guests, handling objections, and a staff cheat sheet."

**[Point to disclaimer]**

> "Quick note on Vineyard: the AI is NOT giving you farming advice. It's helping you organize your week and prepare questions. Always check with your actual viticulture expert."

> "Go ahead and pick one. You have 5 minutes."

**[Walk around, answer questions]**

**[At 4 minutes]**

> "One more minute. When you're done, save or skip to your toolkit."

**[At 5 minutes]**

> "Alright, let's see how that went. Owners - did you get actionable insights? Vineyard folks - useful checklist? Tasting room - scripts you could actually use?"

**[Brief discussion if time allows]**

---

## SLIDE 8: Exercise 3 - Event Marketing (5 minutes)

**[Advance to Event Marketing slide]**

> "This one is my favorite because it's the biggest time-saver."

> "Think about the last time you had to promote an event. Live music night, release party, pickup event. How long did it take to write the Instagram caption, the email, brief the staff?"

> "Watch this."

**[Demo on your phone while narrating]**

> "I'm picking Live Music... Saturday the 15th... targeting wine club members... and I want it to sound authentic, not gimmicky."

**[Hit generate]**

> "In about 10 seconds, I have:
> - Short Instagram caption
> - Long Instagram caption
> - Full email invite
> - 15-second script for staff to tell customers"

> "All consistent. All on-brand. All ready to edit and post."

> "Your turn. Scan and try it."

**[Give them 3 minutes]**

> "Save your favorite output to the toolkit."

---

## SLIDE 9: Exercise 4 - Numbers to Decisions (5 minutes)

**[Advance to Numbers slide]**

> "This one's for everyone who looks at a spreadsheet and thinks 'I know there's something useful in here, but I don't know what.'"

> "You paste numbers - any format, any mess - and get back:
> 1. The best chart to visualize it
> 2. The main insight
> 3. One specific action for this week
> 4. A risk to watch"

> "Use the sample data if you don't have your own. The point is seeing what the output looks like."

**[Give them 3 minutes]**

> "This is the kind of thing that used to require hiring an analyst or spending hours in Excel. Now it's a conversation."

---

## SLIDE 10: Exercise 5 - Lightning Lab (5 minutes)

**[Advance to Lightning Lab slide]**

> "Last exercise. This is the grab bag."

> "You'll see 8 different tools:
> - Staff Training material
> - Labor Schedule
> - Wine Club Campaign
> - Customer SOP
> - Job Description
> - COGS Analysis
> - Compliance Questions
> - Vine Issue Triage"

> "Pick ONE that sounds useful and try it. You have 3 minutes."

**[Walk around]**

> "These are all things that normally take 30 minutes to an hour. The AI gives you a starting point in seconds."

**[At 3 minutes]**

> "Save anything useful to your toolkit."

---

## SLIDE 11: Your Toolkit (1 minute)

**[Advance to Toolkit slide]**

> "Now open your Toolkit - it's at the bottom of the hub, or scan this QR."

> "Everything you saved today is here. Organized by category: Marketing, Operations, Owner decisions."

> "This is yours to keep. Bookmark it. Come back to it tomorrow. Use the prompts as templates."

> "Anyone have an empty toolkit? You can still go back and save things after the session."

---

## SLIDE 12: Key Takeaways (1 minute)

**[Advance to takeaways slide]**

> "Three things I want you to remember:
>
> **One: AI is a drafting tool.** It writes first drafts. You edit and approve. You're always in control.
>
> **Two: Minutes, not hours.** Everything we did today - tasting notes, marketing kits, sales analysis - all took seconds to generate. Your time goes into editing, not creating from scratch.
>
> **Three: No tech skills required.** If you made it through today, you can use AI. It's not about coding or prompts. It's about knowing what you need and letting the tool do the heavy lifting."

---

## SLIDE 13: Beta Interest (1 minute)

**[Advance to Beta slide]**

> "Quick pitch, then I'll let you go."

> "We're building a winery-specific AI assistant. What you used today is a preview. The full version would be:
> - Available anytime, not just at conferences
> - Trained on your brand voice
> - Connected to your data"

> "If what you tried today would save you time every month, scan this code and tell us. No commitment - we just want to know if this is worth building."

---

## SLIDE 14: Closing (30 seconds)

**[Advance to closing slide]**

> "AI drafts. You decide."

> "Thank you for being willing to try something new. Your toolkit is saved. Your prompts are ready to use."

> "I'll be around after the session if you have questions. Or email me - steve@shoofly.ai."

> "Enjoy the rest of the conference."

---

## Post-Session Notes

**Common Questions to Prepare For:**

1. **"Can I use this with my own ChatGPT?"**
   > "Yes! The prompts we used today work in any AI tool. Your toolkit shows you the exact inputs we used."

2. **"Is my data safe?"**
   > "Nothing you enter is stored permanently or used to train AI models. It's a one-time generation."

3. **"What if the AI gives bad advice?"**
   > "That's why you're in the loop. Everything is a draft. Never publish or act on something you haven't reviewed."

4. **"Will this work for [specific task]?"**
   > "Try it! The Lightning Lab has 8 different tools. And the core technique - giving AI context and asking for specific outputs - works for almost anything."

5. **"When is the full product launching?"**
   > "We're gathering interest now. Sign up for the beta to stay informed. No timeline yet - we want to build what wineries actually need."

## Emergency Backup Plans

**If AI service is slow:**
> "The AI is thinking hard for you. While we wait, let me show you what the output will look like..."

**If someone's phone won't load:**
> "Pair up with your neighbor. Two sets of eyes on one screen is actually great for this."

**If you're running out of time:**
> Skip Lightning Lab (Exercise 5). The others are more impactful for the demo.
